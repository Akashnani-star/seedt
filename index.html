 I would call this seed since it’s an amazing way all you need is to put the seed (copy-paste the magnetic link) and grows into big and beautiful tree (the downloaded content). I was fed up with all sorts of downloading trouble i was facing as many sites other than seedr offered this service but data was limited and hence i couldn’t download and torrent takes too much time to download the content with less number of seeds and hence this happened to be an amazing life saver to me.
Seedr is a next-generation app aiming to bring the torrent experience to the next level.
Stream movies, music, and books on any device
With top-in-class streaming technology, Seedr allows you to watch movies, listen to music, or read anything in your torrent library directly from the cloud on any device.
Private and safe
Seedr has high-level transport encryption to protect your privacy, and there is no need to worry about malware, viruses, or outside tracking – Seedr is the barrier protecting you.
Very fast
Seedr runs on a high-speed backbone and can fetch torrents to the cloud within several minutes down to several seconds.
If you’ve ever tried using torrents on either tablet or phone, you’d quickly find out how impractical that is . Seedr is the solution – with special mobile-friendly protocols we created a snappy, fast mobile site that has all the functions you get on your PC – including streaming, subtitles and high speed direct downloads.
We believe that downloading torrents can be friendlier and safer, and plan on expanding the already rich features of the site in the near future.
Overall
Easier to operate than uTorrent (by a long way), Seedr’s beauty lies in its simplicity. It’s hard to imagine anyone other than complete novices needing to revert to the site’s tutorial. However, those that do won’t be disappointed as it reveals ways to integrate the service into Kodi/XBMC.Free tier aside (which is a steal) it’s not cheap at $9.95 per month (two months free on annual rates) so the service might benefit from having a more limited lower-tier premium package around the $6 to $7 mark.
Those who obsess over the minutiae of their torrenting might prefer a full-blown seedbox experience, but Seedr knows its target audience and appears to serve them well.
Seedr can be tested here for free.
